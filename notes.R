# KEY DIFFEFENCES BETWEEN & AND &&

# The & operator is a logical as well as a bitwise operator, as it operates on 
# both booleans as well as binary data whereas, the && operator is only a 
# logical operator as it operates only on a boolean data type.

# The & operator evaluates both the side of the expression to obtain the final 
# result whereas, the && operator evaluates only the left side of the expression 
# & if turn out false it doesn't even evaluate the right side of the expression.

# note
# While evaluating the boolean datatype, both the operators result "true" only 
# if both the operand are true, else it returns "false".

# conclusion
# The & and && operator, both are used to evaluate the boolean condition 
# whereas, the & operator is also used for the bitwise operation. When we 
# require to evaluate both the side of the expression the & operator is used 
# else we can use && operators
